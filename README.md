Sample iOS Guide content for SDL

## How to Use This Guide

Documents in this guide are created in DocDown format. One repo is linked per platform. That means that all iOS guides get created as directories inside this repo. Each directory gets a link in the left-hand sidebar. Guides do not currently support multiple pages or sub-directories.
